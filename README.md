# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## W1
### Activity 1
- Don't procrastinate
- Pay attention to pre-learning slides
- Take notes
- Follow along
- Ask questions

### Activity 2
- Q1: 10
- Q2: 2
- Q3: Print “hello world” in the console every frame
- Q4: MonoBehavior
- Q5: Print “x = 10” in the console when the program starts
- Q6: The “(10)” is the integer assigned to show along with the text “x = ” together that's why we need to use the “+” sign to display “x = 10”. (10) is an argument. (“x = 10” + x) is a parameter.
- Q7: The _playerTransform variable is instantiated but never used.
- Q8: “Transform” is without capital “T”. Correct code =  “transform.translate”
- Q8: Transform.Translate should be replaced with _playerTransform.Translate.

## W4
### Activity 0
N/A

### Activity 1
After writing my code, my other Locator objects delete as soon as I load the game. This is because the code notices that there is another locator objects and based on the if statement, it is set to destroy that other object.

Finished the game

## W5
### Activity 1
I think I would keep the design the same because it makes sense to group the objects into breakables and items. 

### Activity 2
The PlayerW5Demo2, EnemyW5Demo2, InventoryUI classes are the controllers. The EnemyStats and ItemW5Demo2 classes are the model. The DialogueBubble class is the view.

### Activity 3
- Scenario 1: There would be an MVC pattern used here. The controller times when the beats come on and the score. Then the view handles visuals. The model handles the placement and the logo of the buttons.

- Scenario 2: There would be a parent class for the players where the children would have to implement things like animations and meshes. There would be a finite state machine based on player health. There would be good health, critical health, and dead. The singleton would work with the UI where the UI processes first. There would be scriptable objects with the players' different stats. 

- Scenario 3: There would be inheritance with a parent class of plants and children plant types. There would scriptable objects for the plants and rocks information.

### Activity 4

## W6
### Activity 1
- Use a profiler to see what code makes a game laggy.
- Try not to use a polygon collider because it requires a lot more math.
- Try to use standard colliders like the circle.
- Use gizmos to visualize colliders and vectors.
