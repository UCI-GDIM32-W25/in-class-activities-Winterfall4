- Q5: Print “x = 10” in the console when the program starts
- Q6: The “(10)” is the integer assigned to show along with the text “x = ” together that's why we need to use the “+” sign to display “x = 10”. (10) is an argument. (“x = 10” + x) is a parameter.
- Q7: The _playerTransform variable is instantiated but never used.
