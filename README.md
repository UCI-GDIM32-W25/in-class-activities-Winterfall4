# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## W1
### Activity 1
- Don't procrastinate
- Pay attention to pre-learning slides
- Take notes
- Follow along
- Ask questions

### Activity 2
- Q1: 10
- Q2: 2
- Q3: Print “hello world” in the console every frame
- Q4: MonoBehavior
- Q5: Print “x = 10” in the console when the program starts
- Q6: The “(10)” is the integer assigned to show along with the text “x = ” together that's why we need to use the “+” sign to display “x = 10”. (10) is an argument. (“x = 10” + x) is a parameter.
- Q7: The _playerTransform variable is instantiated but never used.
- Q8: “Transform” is without capital “T”. Correct code =  “transform.translate”
- Q8: Transform.Translate should be replaced with _playerTransform.Translate.

### Activity 1
After writing my code, my other Locator objects delete as soon as I load the game. This is because the code notices that there is another locator objects and based on the if statement, it is set to destroy that other object.

## W5
### Activity 1
I think I would keep the design the same because it makes sense to group the objects into breakables and items.
